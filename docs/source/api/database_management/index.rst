Language Management
===================

**PyCafee** provides some ways to control the language in most of the outputs. Almost all functions and classes have a  parameter (``language``) to change the current language. By default, **PyCafee** uses ``"en"`` as language, but is possible to change to ``"pt-br"`` (other languages will be supported in the future. Do you want to help with the translation?).

This change can be made locally for each function/class, but it can also be made persistently.
